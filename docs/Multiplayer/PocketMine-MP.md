# PocketMine-MP

PocketMine-MP (sometimes called PocketMine; abbreviated PMMP or `pmmp`),
is a Free Software server software for the Bedrock Edition.

## History

PocketMine-MP started in the [Pocket Edition](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Pocket_Edition) era,
and since then was adopted by various servers, because it was one of the few options
available, and thanks to its Plugin API, which makes it highly
customizable.[^1]

The first commit was made on 10 October 2012, and targeted Pocket
Edition Demo/0.1.x versions.[^2]

Later versions added support for newer Pocket Edition versions, and
implemented more specific features.
