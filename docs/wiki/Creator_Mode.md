Creator Mode is a special game mode used internally by [Minecraft: Pi
Edition](Minecraft:_Pi_Edition_v0.1.1 "wikilink"). It is almost
identical to the Creative Mode, and it is hardcoded to be the default
MCPI game mode.[^1] The main difference with the Creative Mode is that,
by default, time does not advance, since it does not call a "tick"
function. The API's checkpoints are also different.
