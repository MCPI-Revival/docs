**PocketMine-MP** (sometimes called **PocketMine**; abbreviated **PMMP**
or **pmmp**), is a Free Software server software for the Bedrock
Edition.

## History

PocketMine-MP started in the [Pocket
Edition](Minecraft_Pocket_Edition "wikilink") era, and since then was
adopted by various servers, because it was one of the few options
avaiable, and thanks to its Plugin API, which makes it highly
customizable.[^1]

The first commit was made on 10 October 2012, and targeted Pocket
Edition Demo/0.1.x versions.[^2].

Later versions added support for newer Pocket Edition versions, and
implemented more specific features.
