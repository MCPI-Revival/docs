## 2.0.0 (Legacy)

Reborn got a major updater on June 17, 2021, rehauling much of the codebase to
add new features (like finally the removal of Docker as a dependency).
Docker was replaced with a custom Media Layer Proxy to forward the calls to
GLFW and having the binary run with QEMU. Other notable changes included sound support,
ARM64 support, External Server support instead of a proxy, and binding
the Q key to drop items.

In 2020, it was initially known as "Minecraft: Pi Edition for Docker"
(or MCPI-Docker). In 2021, with the rleeae of 2.0.0, it was renamed to
"Minecraft: Pi Edition: Reborn" after Docker was dropped.
